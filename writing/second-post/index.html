<p>Product is a tough place to start your career in. You start with a wide scope, are given a business goal to pursue, and have to create the structure to make sure your team is on track to achieve those business goals. All while making your customers, devs, triad, and stakeholders happy. It&rsquo;s a lot to take in, and when shit inevitabley hits the fan, you&rsquo;re left wondering if you really are cut out for the job.</p>
<p>But all this is normal. You&rsquo;re destined to fail, but you&rsquo;ll get up, brush it off, and get back to work. There&rsquo;s a few principles I&rsquo;ve learned that have helped keep me focused, resilient, and excited to collab with my team to get shit done.</p>
<h3 id="work-on-high-leverage-taskshttpswwwaakashgcom20220201lno-framework-for-product-managers">Work on <a href="https://www.aakashg.com/2022/02/01/lno-framework-for-product-managers/">High Leverage Tasks</a></h3>
<p>Understanding your place as the PM and working on high leverage tasks are how you move the needle on lofty goals and how you build trust with your team. Your time is limited, so be intentional about what you do everyday For example, instead of grooming the backlog and writing out detailed specs all the time, allow your designer and engineers to own the details. Bring them in early to the ideation process and allow them to make the right calls. It&rsquo;ll free you up to take on even more important work. Learn to identify when you aren&rsquo;t working on high leverage tasks, and course correct often.</p>
